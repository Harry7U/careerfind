     "telegram_chat_id": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID",
     "proxy_address": "localhost:1080",
     "request_timeout_seconds": 30,
     "rate_limit_ms": 1000
   }
   ```

5. Build the application:
   ```sh
   go build -o careerfind
   ```

6. Run the tool with desired options:
   ```sh
   ./careerfind -L "San Francisco" -p -b "all" -l -o json -a -v
   ```

### Command-line Arguments & Options
| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-L` | Filter by location (city/country) | Required |
| `-p` | Enable proxy support | false |
| `-b` | Search engines (google,bing,duckduckgo,all) | "all" |
| `-l` | Enable LinkedIn mode | false |
| `-o` | Output format (json,csv,txt) | "json" |
| `-m` | Notification method (telegram,none) | "telegram" |
| `-a` | Enable automation (daily cron job) | false |
| `-v` | Verbose mode | false |
| `-version` | Show version information | false |

## 💡 Example Commands

1. Basic search:
```sh
./careerfind -L "New York"
```

2. Full featured search:
```sh
./careerfind -L "San Francisco" -p -b "all" -l -o json -m telegram -v -a
```

3. Quick test without notifications:
```sh
./careerfind -L "Test Location" -o json -m none -v
```

4. Automated daily run:
```sh
./careerfind -L "Multiple Cities" -a -o json -v
```

### Output Files
- Results: `$HOME/.local/share/careerfind/results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.{json|csv|txt}`
- Logs: `$HOME/.local/share/careerfind/careerfind.log`

### Expected Output Structure
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "emails": ["example@company.com"],
      "location": "https://example.com/careers",
      "timestamp": "2025-03-19T17:52:21Z",
      "source": "https://example.com/careers/job-posting"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
1. Check version:
```sh
./careerfind -version
```

2. Enable verbose logging:
```sh
./careerfind -L "Test" -v 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

3. Common issues:
- Rate limiting: Adjust `RATE_LIMIT_MS` environment variable
- Timeout errors: Increase `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` value
- Proxy errors: Verify proxy server is running and accessible
- Permission errors: Check write permissions in `$HOME/.local/share/careerfind`

## 🔐 Security Notes
- Use environment variables instead of config.json for sensitive data
- Always use proxy support (-p) when scraping at scale
- Review the logs for any blocked requests or errors
- Consider using different proxy addresses for different search engines
- Keep your Go installation and dependencies up to date
